# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.5.7] - 2026-09-07

### Added

- HomeBox devices can now be deleted from the device page. The integration implements `async_remove_config_entry_device`, so Home Assistant enables the "Delete" button for HomeBox-owned devices — useful for removing stray/duplicate devices left behind when a linked device is deleted while still linked. The removal is Home Assistant-side only: if the device was tracked in the link map, its mapping is dropped so it is not recreated on the next reload, but the HomeBox item and its backlink are left untouched (deleting a possibly-stray HA device never modifies HomeBox).

## [0.5.6] - 2026-09-07

### Fixed

- Reverted the linked diagnostic sensors (`HomeBox ID`, battery depletion) to attach via `DeviceInfo` (as in 0.5.3). The 0.5.4 change bound them to the device by id instead, which avoided duplicate "twin" devices but stopped linked devices from being associated with the HomeBox config entry — so they no longer appeared under the HomeBox integration or read as linked, and adding from discovery looked like it did nothing. Attaching via `DeviceInfo` restores that association. Any duplicate devices created when a source integration's device is momentarily unavailable are hidden from the import wizard by the config-entry ownership filter added in 0.5.4.

## [0.5.5] - 2026-09-07

### Changed

- Removed the automatic self-heal that adopted existing HomeBox backlinks into the local link map on every load (introduced in 0.5.2). It silently re-linked previously-linked items when the integration was re-added, so tagged items no longer resurfaced in the linking/discovery flow. Tagged items that still carry a backlink but are not in the local link map are now held back rather than adopted; the "Refresh tagged" action clears such stale backlinks, after which the items are offered for linking again — restoring the "refresh, then add the devices" workflow.

## [0.5.4] - 2026-09-07

### Fixed

- Fixed linked diagnostic sensors (`HomeBox ID`, battery depletion) creating a duplicate "twin" device instead of attaching to the real one. They previously supplied `DeviceInfo` with the linked device's identifiers copied in; when the owning integration's device was momentarily absent at setup (observed with Matter/Thread devices reporting unavailable), Home Assistant materialized a second device carrying the same identifier. These sensors now bind to the existing device by its device id and never create a device (superseding the 0.5.3 `DeviceInfo` approach), and existing sensors migrate onto the real device on reload.
- Fixed the bulk import wizard listing already-linked and HomeBox-owned devices as selectable link targets. The selectable list again excludes everything in the link map, and additionally excludes devices the HomeBox config entry owns (its hub and any stray duplicate devices). Already-linked devices shown for reference are derived from the link map.
- Made the daily refresh resilient: the link scan only fetches item details for items not already tracked locally, and a scan/forecast failure no longer prevents the integration from loading (only a core statistics failure does), reducing intermittent "HomeBox integration is not loaded" errors.

## [0.5.3] - 2026-09-07

### Fixed

- Fixed linked diagnostic sensors occasionally attaching to a nameless device that displays as "HomeBox" instead of the real device, by carrying the linked device's name/manufacturer/model on the sensor's `DeviceInfo`. (Superseded in 0.5.4, which stops creating a device from these sensors altogether.)

## [0.5.2] - 2026-09-06

### Fixed

- Fixed the link scanner no longer seeing a HomeBox item's backlink after the entities migration: the new `/v1/entities` list responses omit an item's custom `fields`, so tagged items are now fetched in detail to read the Home Assistant backlink instead of the list summary.
- Fixed purchase and sold dates being wiped on item updates: the entities API renamed `purchaseTime`/`soldTime` to `purchaseDate`/`soldDate`, which were not carried over in the update payload.

### Added

- Added a "Bulk create HomeBox items from all devices" option to the integration options menu, letting you select unlinked devices across all areas in one list instead of one area at a time.

## [0.5.1] - 2026-04-25

### Changed

- Migrated all API calls to the new HomeBox unified entities API, replacing the removed `/v1/items/*` and `/v1/locations/*` endpoints with `/v1/entities/*`.
- Location creation now uses the `/v1/entity-types` API to resolve and cache the location entity type ID.
- Location listing now handles paginated responses from the new entities endpoint.
- Updated all request payloads: `locationId` is now `parentId`, `syncChildItemsLocations` is now `syncChildEntityLocations`.
- Updated all response parsing: `location` field replaced by `parent` on entity responses.
- Attachment and maintenance endpoint paths updated to `/v1/entities/{id}/attachments` and `/v1/entities/{id}/maintenance`.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-04-12

### Added

- Added three HA service actions for triggering HomeBox maintenance from automations:
  - `homebox.add_maintenance`: creates a pending maintenance entry on the HomeBox item linked to the given entity's device. Accepts `name` (required), `description` (optional), and `scheduled_date` (optional, defaults to today).
  - `homebox.delete_maintenance`: deletes all pending maintenance entries matching a given name for the linked item.
  - `homebox.clear_maintenance`: clears all pending maintenance entries for the linked item.
  - All actions accept any entity whose device is linked to HomeBox, not just HomeBox sensors.
- Items whose `HomeAssistant` tag is removed in HomeBox are now automatically unlinked from HA on the next coordinator poll.
- Missing backlink fields on linked items are now automatically restored by the coordinator.

### Fixed

- Fixed backlink detection rejecting fields with an empty `textValue`.
- Guard against `None` coordinator data in the battery depletion sensor and discovery flow.
- Scoped bare `except` to known API error types in maintenance sync.
- Fixed `maintenance_due_next_week` double-counting items due today.

## [0.4.2] - 2026-03-29

### Added

- Added a bulk area import wizard in integration options to create and link HomeBox items from multiple Home Assistant devices in one flow.

### Changed

- Bulk device selection now requires explicit user choice (no auto-selected first item).
- Bulk import now preserves links for all selected devices across the full run.

### Removed

- Removed the separate Integrations-page top-right Add button flow for creating HomeBox items (subentry path).

## [0.4.1] - 2026-03-28

### Added

- Added integration subentry support so the Integrations page "Add" button can create and link a new HomeBox item from a Home Assistant device.
- Added `missing_config_entry` abort translations for English and German.

### Changed

- Updated subentry action labels to "Create new HomeBox item" (EN) / "Neues HomeBox Element erstellen" (DE).
- Improved HomeBox API error detail handling to include server-provided messages where available.

### Fixed

- Fixed create/link flow to always apply the HomeAssistant tag after item creation, including create fallback paths.
- Fixed `InvalidAuth` initialization to call the base `HomeAssistantError` constructor.
- Fixed options flow edge cases by guarding missing `runtime_data` instead of crashing.
- Refactored duplicated create/link logic into shared helpers and restored stage-based error logging.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-03-22

### Added

- Added linked battery forecast support with a per-device diagnostic date sensor for estimated battery depletion.
- Added HomeBox maintenance synchronization: linked battery forecasts now create and update maintenance entries directly in HomeBox.

- Battery detection now supports more real-world entity registry variants (`device_class` and `original_device_class`).
- HomeBox maintenance descriptions were simplified to battery-focused lines only.
- Maintenance cost is now auto-derived from battery quantity (default `1` when unknown).

## [0.3.1] - 2026-03-22

### Changed

- Streamlined linking options by removing legacy manual-link wizard steps and related dead code.
- Adjusted coordinator polling interval to 1 hour.
